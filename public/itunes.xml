    <itunes:subtitle>Serious Introspection is a weekly live show at Mad House Helsinki that attempts to uncover the motivations and processes of the creative act.</itunes:subtitle>
    <itunes:summary>Put the brakes on the avant-garde with Serious Introspection, a weekly live show hosted by John W. Fail (Ptarmigan, Pixelache, etc.) with Hype Man Justin Tyler Tate. Each week, John will talk to performers, organisers, curators and producers from Mad House’s activities and beyond. The goal is to peel back the layers on the creative process, while seeking direct, human communication. It’s intended to be a space for total honesty, and topics may be germane or pleasantly irrelevant. In addition to invited guests and rotating co-hosts, audience members may be invited on stage to discuss their feelings and reactions to what’s being discussed. </itunes:summary>

    <description>After some delay (sorry, I am lazy when it comes to my video editing responsibilities), here is season 2, episode 3 from 1 March 2016. Martina Marti was on first to discuss her work Reverie with Gnab Collective, as well as the general balance of being an artirst vs. and administrator, and the different approaches to these topics. Then we had Juuso Paaso, who has been working with the Oranssi Pienlehtiarkisto, here talking about zine culture in Finland and his digitisation efforts.

In addition, Justin and I settled some beef, Juuso and I sang a Daniel Johnston song, and I did a STRONG FIVE about the Uberman Sleep Schedule. Ernest provided his tweets, seen here on-screen and followable @room4error via #SeriousIntrospection.</description>

    <description>This week we had Juha Valkeapää to talk about his production 2341 AD, and Malin Gustavsson who explained a bit about her work as a diversity consultant. We also channeled the spirit of a country and western supergroup, phoned John's parents, and met the Pope Urban VII of Mad House Helsinki. As always, it couldn't happen without Justin Tyler Tate (world's best hype man), Ernest Truely (follow @room4error!), video master Lotta Blomberg, and sound master Joosep Tormis.</description>

    <title>Serious Introspection S02E01: Welcome back with Marianna Keisalo, Helen Korpak, Iina Esko and Paola de Ramos</title>

    <description>We started the new season of Serious Introspection last week at Mad House, and we came back strong (I hope). Guests were standup comedienne/anthropologist Marianna Keisalo, Kosminen and Khaos Publishing's Helen Korpak and Iina Esko, and Brasilian artist Paola de Ramos. We debuted some new segments, enjoyed the strange glow of a 4:3 aspect ratio projector, and enjoyed seeing the audience again. Plus, balls.

Here is the video for your enjoyment, featuring embedded tweets courtesy of Ernest (@room4error).

We're off next week but we'll be back on the 24th for a special #ErrEvening night, and also with guest Juha Valkeapää!</description>

    <title>Serious Introspection S01E08: Season finale with Nikos Doulos and Mad House staff</title>
    <link>http://johnw.fail/posts/serious-introspection-episode-8</link>
    <guid>https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/icewhistle-content/serious_introspection/s01e08.mp4</guid>
    <description>Here's the last episode of Serious Introspection, which was by far the best one (from my perspective, at least). We had a large and hungry audience and great guests and a real spirit of absurdity. Guests were Nikos Doulous and some of the Mad House working group (Heidi Backström, Mirva Pulkkinen and Annika Tudeer); also included were statistical analysis, Minor Threat karaoke, and the one-time-only appearance of the 'What is John learning in (an) art school?' segment. We closed with a smashing music video/clip show.
  
     Thanks again to everyone at Mad House - those on stage, Juha Valkeapää, and everyone else - and to Kimmo Modig who launched this enterpise in the first place. We'll be back for Mad House's third season, beginning in February, and we'll post more details as we know them. In the meantime, we are available to be hired for parties, bar mitzvahs and other events via the SI Services enterprise, and you can check out our new standalone website for Serious Introspection at seriousintrospection.fi. </description>

  <description>Here is this week's episode, with Tero Nauha, Milla Koistinen, Salka Gudmundsdóttir and impromptu guest Tuukka Asplund. We passed out feedback forms to the audience and presented the new for-profit wing of Serious Introspection, SI Services (found at http://services.johnw.fail). 

We were without a sound man for the third consecutive week but did not have Ilpo to save the day, so all of the mics are really hot and the soundboard mix sounds terrible. I tried the best I could with post-processing but this episode is again really hard to listen to. I apologise immensely and almost didn't post this video at all, but figured some bad-sounding documentation is better than nothing.</description>

<title>Serious Introspection S01E06: Jaakko Blomberg &amp; the Post-MJ Era Institute of Consciousness</title>

<guid>https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/icewhistle-content/serious_introspection/s01e06.mp4</guid>
<description>Episode six brought together Jaakko Blomberg of Yhteismaa and Ossi Koskelainen, Ilpo Heikkinen &amp; Emmi Venna of the Post-MJ Era Institute of Consciousness. We discussed legacy, openness, social boundaries, memories, divorce, and shark costumes. I unsuccessfully tried to get rid of a Gertrude Stein book, played Michael Jackson trivia, and saw St. Elmo's Fire spitting ions in the ether.

Hey, sorry, we had some tech difficulties again. More camera fuckups and the audio feed was missing some mics, so I had to mix in some camera sound and it's not optimal. I promise we'll get back on track next week, when our trusted technical supervisor will be back. Tero Nauha will be there to talk about his book launch, and we'll try some other hijinks. There's only two episodes left so if you're in Helsinki, please come along! Thanks also to Mad House for letting us do this show in the first place, and please don't miss the rest of Mad House's 2nd season programme.</description>

<description>Those of you who saw Matthew Goulish on my show last week (or on the video here) know how much I admire his writing and approach to art and performance. I wanted to talk further with him (and with Lin Hixson, who didn't come on stage during episode 5) while they were in Helsinki, so we recorded a conversation which is presented here in podcast format. Among the topics discussed were interruptions, reversing course, limitations, permission, fear, comfort zones, walking across the room 10000 times, respect, skepticism, dogma, generosity, and peripheral consciousness.</description>

<description>It's the TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES episode! With our trusted sound man in Estonia we had to figure it out ourselves, mainly, 'where do they store the microphones?' and thus we started a half-hour late, and I was agitated throughout. It's also the AMERICA episode! With guests Megan Snowe (USA), Ernest Truely (USA), Matthew Goulish (USA) and myself and Justin as always. Special thanks to Ilpo Heikkinen for stepping in and being a pop-up sound guy/saviour. I love him, even if he isn't American.</description>

Special thanks to Ilpo Heikkinen for stepping in and being a pop-up sound guy/saviour. I love him, even if he isn't American.

Despite the slow start I think this was our best episode yet, and I was thrilled to have Matthew on the show as his work has influenced me a great deal. And I wish Megan could be on the show every week. Here's the video, with live tweets by Ernest (@room4error) superimposed where appropriate. Sorry the lighting isn't as pleasant and before; I guess our sound man usually handles that too. It's the DARK episode!

Next week (10 November) is episiode 6 - the ANTEPENULTIMATE episode! -  starting at 18:00 as always at Ihana Baari/Mad House Helsinki. Guests will include Jaakko Blomberg from Yhteismaa and several representatives of the Post-MJ Era Institute of Consciousness. And if you can't make it, you can still follow us on Facebook (send in those mailbag questions!) and check the hashtag #SeriousIntrospection for future livetweets and other interactions.</itunes:summary>

<description>Here's the hastily edited video from this week's episode of Serious Introspection with John W. Fail, which was a good one - featuring Hanne Ivars, Synes Elischka and Harriina Räinä as well as hype man Justin Tyler Tate. We talked about Bruce Conner films, interactivity in art, and how to make fake blood. And we played a game based on my life. There was a camera failure so we didn't have as much footage to work with this time, and I also tried to superimpose Ernest Truely's live tweets on the video, which is maybe funny or maybe annoying. </description>

<itunes:subtitle>Kristinsson &amp; Fredriksson talk about their tea performance and we try to play a game with the audience. </itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Here is episode 3, from last week at Ihana Baari. Guests were Kristinsson &amp; Fredriksson, and we attempted a subjective 'trivia' game which flopped due to low audience participation. Thanks to Justin Tyler Tate as always for being a great hype man, and to Lotta Blomberg for taking care of the videographing and editing. </itunes:summary>

<description>Here's episode 2 of Serious Introspection with John W. Fail, my weekly live/talk show at Mad House Helsinki. This week I talked with Annika Tudeer, Andrew Paterson, and Kimmo Modig. It was a significantly more lively show than last time, and I felt way better about it. I apologise for the audio being terrible - it makes this quite hard to listen to, but next week we will ensure that we get a better recording. </description>
